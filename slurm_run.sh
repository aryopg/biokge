# =================================
# Move input data to scratch disk
# =================================
# Move data from a source location, probably on the distributed filesystem
# (DFS), to the scratch space on the selected node. Your code should read and
# write data on the scratch space attached directly to the compute node (i.e.
# not distributed), *not* the DFS. Writing/reading from the DFS is extremely
# slow because the data must stay consistent on *all* nodes. This constraint
# results in much network traffic and waiting time for you!
#
# This example assumes you have a folder containing all your input data on the
# DFS, and it copies all that data  file to the scratch space, and unzips it. 
#
# For more guidelines about moving files between the distributed filesystem and
# the scratch space on the nodes, see:
#     http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/cluster-tips

echo "Moving input data to the compute node's scratch space: $SCRATCH_DISK"

# # input data directory path on the DFS
src_path=/home/${USER}/kge-playground/dataset/ogbl_ppa

# # input data directory path on the scratch disk of the node
dest_path=${SCRATCH_HOME}/kge-playground/dataset/ogbl_ppa
mkdir -p ${dest_path}  # make it if required

# Important notes about rsync:
# * the --compress option is going to compress the data before transfer to send
#   as a stream. THIS IS IMPORTANT - transferring many files is very very slow
# * the final slash at the end of ${src_path}/ is important if you want to send
#   its contents, rather than the directory itself. For example, without a
#   final slash here, we would create an extra directory at the destination:
#       ${SCRATCH_HOME}/kge-playground/data/input/input
# * for more about the (endless) rsync options, see the docs:
#       https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.html

# Finally, run the experiment!
# ==============================
# Read line number ${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID} from the experiment file and run it
# ${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID} is simply the number of the job within the array. If
# you execute `sbatch --array=1:100 ...` the jobs will get numbers 1 to 100
# inclusive.

# ======================================
# Move output data from scratch to DFS

# This presumes your command wrote data to some known directory. In this
# example, send it back to the DFS with rsync
